# sunfish_rs
Rust "port" of the sunfish simple chess engine

# Credits:
- [The original sunfish](https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish)
- [yuri91](https://github.com/yuri91) for making a first rust port that inspired this

# How to play:
Right now it's only supporting a very basic subset of UCI, will soon add option to choose a simple cli

Challenge it on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/sunfish_rs) and tell me what you think!
